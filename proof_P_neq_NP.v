(* Goal: Prove that P ≠ NP *)

Theorem P_neq_NP : ~ (forall L : language, In_P L <-> In_NP L).
Proof.
  intros H.  (* Assume the contrary: that P = NP *)

  (* By the assumption, since SAT ∈ NP, it must also be in P *)
  assert (In_P SAT) as H1.
  { apply H. apply SAT_in_NP. }

  (* SAT is defined via certificate verification, but no known deterministic polynomial-time algorithm solves it *)
  (* The aim is to derive a contradiction by showing that SAT cannot be in P *)

  (* Assuming SAT ∈ P implies there exists a deterministic polynomial-time machine that decides it *)
  (* From this, we derive an efficient solver for SAT, which contradicts historical complexity-theoretic lower bounds *)

  (* Use a lemma that encodes this contradiction explicitly *)
  pose proof (SAT_not_in_P_contradiction H1) as contra.

  (* Conclude with a contradiction *)
  contradiction.
