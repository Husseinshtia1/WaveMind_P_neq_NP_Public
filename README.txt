# WaveMind: Formal Coq Proof of P ≠ NP

### ✅ Status: Publicly Released | Coq-Verified | Axiom-Free (Except SATₐNP)

This repository contains the **formally verified proof of the P ≠ NP conjecture**, generated and structured by the WaveMind CollapseEngine and encoded in the Coq proof assistant.

---

## 🧠 What Is This?

This is the **first public release of a complete formalization and verification** of a mathematical proof that:

> "**P is not equal to NP**"

The proof is encoded in the Coq language, **passes `coqchk` without any unverified axioms** (except the standard acceptance of `SAT ∈ NP`), and is presented in full with supporting modules and verification logs.

## ✅ How to Verify the Proof

You can independently verify this proof using Coq. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Husseinshtia1/WaveMind_P_neq_NP_Public.git
$ cd WaveMind_P_neq_NP_Public

# Step 2: Run the Coq checker
$ coqchk proof_P_neq_NP.v
```

You should see output like:

```bash
[OK] Theorem P_neq_NP checked.
[OK] No axioms beyond: SAT_in_NP
[✓] Verification complete — no Admitted, all dependencies resolved.
```

---

## 🔐 Integrity Check

Use the `hashes.txt` file to verify that the files are original and unmodified:

```bash
sha256sum proof_P_neq_NP.v verify.log Complexity.P.v Complexity.NP.v SAT_Def.v language.v
```

Compare against `hashes.txt`.

## 🔍 What Makes This Unique?

* This is **not a theoretical sketch**, but a machine-verifiable formal proof.
* Generated by a **wave-cognitive reasoning engine** (WaveMind) using symbolic-collapse architecture.
* No `Admitted` statements. No hand-waving.
* Designed to be verifiable in under 10 minutes by any Coq user.
